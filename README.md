Let's Begin
Hello, Welcome in our brand new startup where everything has to be done!

"Step 1": We just got some cash to implement a big part of our first feature. We need you to implement a service (we will let aside the Rest/web service side of it). It will take a number (positive integer) and provide:

"Foo" if this number is multiple of 3
"Bar" if this number is multiple of 5
If number have several multiples, they appear in natural order (Foo, Bar).

We will return the given number as a string if there is no transformation to do.

Once this step is complete, read and do step 2.
